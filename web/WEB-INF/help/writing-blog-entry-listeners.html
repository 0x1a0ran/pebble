      Blog entry listeners are a type of Pebble plugin that allow you to write code that is called
      whenever a blog entry is added, removed, changed, approved or rejected. To write your own listener, you need to write a Java class that implements the <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/blogentry/BlogEntryListener.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.api.listener.blogentry.BlogEntryListener</a> interface
      as shown below. To gain access to the associated <a href="../javadoc/pebble/blog/BlogEntry.html">blog entry</a>, use the <code>getBlogEntry()</code> method on the
      <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/blogentry/BlogEntryEvent.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.api.listener.blogentry.BlogEntryEvent</a> object
      that is passed to the callback methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        An empty implementation is provided by the <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/blogentry/BlogEntryListenerSupport.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.api.listener.blogentry.BlogEntryListenerSupport</a> class, which
        you can use as a starting point.
      </p>
