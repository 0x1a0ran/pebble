      <p>
      TrackBack listeners are a type of Pebble plugin that allow you to write code that is called
      whenever a TrackBack is added, removed, approved or rejected. To write your own listener, you need to write a Java class that implements the <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/TrackBackListener.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.api.listener.trackback.TrackBackListener</a> interface
      as shown below. To gain access to the associated <a href="../javadoc/pebble/blog/TrackBack.html">TrackBack</a>, use the <code>getTrackBack()</code> method on the <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/TrackBackEvent.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.api.listener.trackback.TrackBackEvent</a> object
      that is passed to the callback methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        An empty implementation is provided by the <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/trackback/TrackBackListenerSupport.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.api.listener.trackback.TrackBackListenerSupport</a> class, which
        you can use as a starting point. If you are writing an implementation that is useful for both comments and TrackBacks, you can
        use the <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/response/BlogEntryResponseListenerSupport.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.listener.response.BlogEntryResponseListenerSupport</a>
        as a starting point instead, where there are similar blogEntryResponseX() methods.
      </p>
