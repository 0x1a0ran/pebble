      <p>
      Starting with version 1.6, Pebble maintains access logs to record all requests that are made to your blog. These are stored in the <code>blog.dir/logs</code> directory and log files are rotated at the end of each day. The files
      themselves are written in the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/logs.html#combined">Combined Log Format</a> and contain information including the visitor's IP address, the requested URI, the date/time and the visitor's user agent (browser type). This information is the basis
      for the simple reporting features described below. However, since Pebble uses a standard format for its logs, more complex reports (e.g. number of unique visitors per day) can be generated by
      using any of the standard log file tools that are used to analyse webserver (e.g. Apache) logs.

      <h5>Log Summary for Month</h5>
      To see a summary of the number of requests for the current month, click the <b>Log summary</b> link in the <b>Blog administration</b> section after logging in. This will show
      the total number of requests for each day in the month and additional links will take you to further detail for each day.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h5>Log File for Today</h5>
      To see the raw log file for today, click the <b>Log</b> link after logging in.
      <p>

      <p>
      <h5>Referers for Today</h5>
      To see the referers for today, click the <b>Referers</b> link after logging in. This is the same page as described in the <a href="referers.html">referers</a> section.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h5>Requests for Today</h5>
      To see the referers for today, click the <b>Referers</b> link after logging in.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h5>Exporting the Log Files</h5>
      For convenience, Pebble has a facility to let you export all of your log files as a ZIP file. This allows you to analyse your log files without manually FTPing the files across from your server. To do this, click the <b>ZIP file</b> link after logging in.
      </p>

      <p>
      <h5>Housekeeping</h5>
      Like those generated from most webservers, the log files generated by Pebble are fairly verbose and can use a large quantity of disk space after a while. For this reason, you should consider deleting or archiving your logs on a regular basis. For example, you could choose to zip them up at the end of each month/year.

      <h5>Switching Logging Implementations</h5>
      Pebble is distributed with the following logging implementations.

      <td valign="top">
        net.sourceforge.pebble.logging.CombinedLogFormatLogger
      </td>
      <td>
        A logger that writes log files in the the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/logs.html#combined">Combined Log Format</a>.
        This is the default logger for Pebble blogs.
      </td>
      </tr>

      <tr class="itemBodyEven">
      <td valign="top">
        net.sourceforge.pebble.logging.NullLogger
      </td>
      <td>
        A no-op logger that can be used when Pebble logging isn't required, such
        as when something like Apache provides the necessary logging already.
      </td>
      </tr>

      </table>
      </div>

      <p>
      To configure which logger is used by your blog, simply modify the <b>Logger</b> plugin on the <a href="plugins.html">plugins page</a>. By default, <code>net.sourceforge.pebble.logging.CombinedLogFormatLogger</code> is used.
