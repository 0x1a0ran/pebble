      TrackBacks (<a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/beginners/">definition</a>) are another mechanism for visitors to leave feedback on your blog. Where comments are responses that are left on your blog, TrackBacks  are effectively links back to responses that somebody has written on their website.
      As with comments, the number of TrackBacks that have been received for a particular blog entry is shown underneath the entry. Clicking the "TrackBacks[x]" link will take you to the TrackBacks for that blog entry.

      In addition to receiving TrackBacks, Pebble can also send a TrackBack to another TrackBack-enabled blog. To send a TrackBack, go to the permalinked page for the blog entry that you wish to send the TrackBack from and click the "Send TrackBack" link.

      If a blog supports TrackBacks, it will provide you with a URL to which they should be sent. In addition to a link back to your blog entry, a short excerpt describing/summarizing your blog entry is sent and can be edited as necessary before being sent.
