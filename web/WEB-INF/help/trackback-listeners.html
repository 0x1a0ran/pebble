      TrackBack listeners are a type of Pebble plugin that allows custom code to be called
      whenever a TrackBack is added or removed. The following TrackBack listeners are included with the Pebble distribution.

      <div class="centeredBlock">
      <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8">

      <td valign="top">
        net.sourceforge.pebble.event.trackback.EmailNotificationListener
      </td>
      <td>
        Sends a notification e-mail when a new TrackBack is added to the blog owner, additionally asking for approval if the status of the TrackBack is pending.
      </td>
      </tr>

      <tr class="itemBodyEven">
      <td valign="top">
        net.sourceforge.pebble.event.response.MarkPendingListener
      </td>
      <td>
        Marks all new TrackBacks with a status of pending so that they require approval from a blog contributor before being published on the blog.
      </td>
      </tr>

      <tr class="itemBodyOdd">
      <td valign="top">
        net.sourceforge.pebble.event.response.IpAddressListener
      </td>
      <td>
        Maintains both a blacklist and a whitelist of IP addresses, performing the following when a new TrackBack is added.
        <ol>
        <li>If the IP address of the TrackBack is contained within the blacklist, the TrackBack is marked as pending and the TrackBack's spam score is increased by 1 point.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, if the IP address of the TrackBack is contained within the whitelist, the TrackBack is left as-is.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, if the IP address of the TrackBack is contained in neither list, the TrackBack is marked as pending and the spam score remains unaffected.</li>
        </ol>
        In addition to this, the TrackBack's IP address is removed from the blacklist (if applicable) and added to the whitelist when it is approved. Vice versa for TrackBacks that are rejected.
        <br /><br />
        The comma separated lists of IP addresses are stored under the <code>IpAddressListener.blacklist</code> and <code>IpAddressListener.whitelist</code> plugin properties.

      <td>
        Checks the content of new TrackBacks for the number of links that they contain. If this is greater than the threshold,
        the TrackBack is marked as pending and the TrackBack's spam score is increased by 1 point.
        <br /><br />
        The default threshold for the number of links is 3, but can be configured by the
        <code>LinkSpamListener.trackbackThreshold</code> plugin property.

        Checks the content of new TrackBacks for specific regular expressions. If the number of occurences
        is greater than the threshold, the TrackBack is marked as pending and the TrackBack's spam score is increased by 1 point. This is repeated
        for the title, author and website properties too.
        <br /><br />
        The default threshold for the number of occurences is 0, but can be configured by the <code>ContentSpamListener.threshold</code> plugin property.
        <br /><br />
        The list of
        regular expressions can be configured using the <code>ContentSpamListener.regexList</code> property.
