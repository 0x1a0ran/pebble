      Each blog entry can be organized into one or more categories, the categories being defined as a hierarchy
      starting at the root category with an ID of "/". Underneath this, more categories can be defined in a file
      system style structure, with the forward slash character being used to specify levels in the hierarchy. For example,
      in the screenshot below, there are three top-level categories of Apple (/apple), Java (/java) and Pebble (/pebble). In addition to this, the
      Java category has a subcategory of JavaOne (/java/javaone).
