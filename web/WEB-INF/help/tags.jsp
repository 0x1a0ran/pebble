          Pebble features the ability to tag your blog entries and at the simplest level, this involves adding a
          space separated list of tags to your blog entry when you edit that blog entry. Then, using the
          <code>net.sourceforge.pebble.plugin.decorator.BlogTagsDecorator</code>, this list of tags can be displayed underneath each blog entry.
          </p>

          <p>
          <div align="center">
          <img src="./images/tags-1.png" />
          </div>
          </p>

          <p>
          <h5>Category tagging</h5>
          Pebble also allows you to add tags to categories, again
          by specifying a comma separated list of tags when you edit the category. Thereafter, whenever a blog entry is placed into
          a tagged category, that blog entry also picks up the tags belonging to all of its categories. In effect, this provides
          a way to bulk tag all blog entries in a particular category. Also, with hierarchical categories, a sub-category
          will inherit all of the tags from its parents.
          </p>

          <p>
          <h5>Tagcloud</h5>
          When tags are being utilised, the included themes provide a link called <b>Tags</b> that allows you to
          see a tagcloud for your blog as follows.
          </p>

          <p>
          <div align="center">
          <img src="./images/tags-2.png" />
          </div>
          </p>

          <p>
          The size of a link provides an indication as to the relative numbers of blog entries that use
          that tag, while hovering over it shows the actual number. Clicking the link will take you to
          a list of all blog entries using that tag. Please note that if you change the tags associated with a category, you should
          reload your blog so that the tagcloud is recreated.
