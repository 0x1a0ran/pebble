        Pebble allows visitors to leave comments on your blog entries and although comments are enabled for new blog entries by default, they can be disabled so that comments can't be left.
        In the default theme, the number of comments for any blog entry is shown underneath the blog entry itself along with a <b>Comments[x]</b> link that takes you to the comments for that entry.
        Pebble supports nested comments for threads of conversation and allows readers to preview their comments before posting them to your blog.

        <h5>Removing comments</h5>
        If for any reason you wish to remove a comment, just click the <b>Remove</b> link next to the appropriate comment and click OK when asked for confirmation. Like the other admin features, this link will only show up if you have logged in. Also, if you are logged in, you will see the e-mail and IP address of the comment author.
      </p>

        <h5>E-mail notifications</h5>
        Pebble can be configured to create an e-mail notification when new comments are added, sending it to the blog owner and
        anybody that has left a comment for that blog entry and specified their e-mail address. To encourage further
        discussion via comments and prevent e-mail addresses being harvested for spam, a separate e-mail is sent to each person.
        It's also worth mentioning that e-mail addresses are not publicly displayed on the comments page too.
        </p>

        <p>
        To enable e-mail notifications, ensure that your e-mail address and SMTP server are defined on the
        <a href="configuration.jsp">Blog properties</a> page and add the following class name to the list of
        <a href="comment-listeners.html">comment listeners</a> on the <a href="plugins.html">plugins</a> page.
        <ul>
        <li><code>net.sourceforge.pebble.event.comment.EmailNotificationListener</code></li>
        </ul>
        Readers can opt-out of these e-mails on a per blog entry basis by entering their e-mail address in the form at the bottom of the blog entry permalink page.
        This will remove their e-mail address from any comments that they have made on that blog entry so they will
        not receive any more e-mails when further comments are added. A direct opt-out link is included in the e-mail for convenience.
      </p>
