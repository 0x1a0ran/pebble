        <img src="./images/newsfeeds-1.png" hspace="8" align="right" class="screenshot" />Pebble can generate the three most common type of newsfeeds that news aggregators
        can subscribe to.
        <ul>
        <li><b>RSS 2.0</b> - &lt;URL of your blog&gt;/rss.xml</li>
        <li><b>RDF 1.0</b> - &lt;URL of your blog&gt;/rdf.xml</li>
        <li><b>Atom 1.0</b> - &lt;URL of your blog&gt;/atom.xml</li>
        </ul>
        At any point in time, each of these feeds contains only those blog entries that
        are seen on the front page of your blog, the number of which is configured by the
        <b>Recent blog entries</b> property on the <a href="configuration.jsp">Blog properties</a> page.
        With the default theme, links to these feeds are shown at the top of your blog, as illustrated in the
        screenshot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h5>Category-specific feeds</h5>
        In addition to generating feeds that cover the whole of your blog, Pebble can also generate
        feeds that are specific to a single category. Links to these feeds can be seen by clicking the
        <b>Other</B> link illustrated in the screenshot above.
