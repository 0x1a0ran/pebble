      Blog listeners are a type of Pebble plugin that allows custom code to be called
      whenever your blog is started and stopped. Example uses include:
      <ul>
        <li>Initialising/flushing a cache when the blog is started/stopped.</li>
        <li>Opening/closing a connection to an external data source that is used by another type of Pebble plugin.</li>
        <li>Starting/stopping a thread that subscribes to an RSS feed and automatically posts new content to your blog.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      There are currently no implementations distributed with Pebble.
