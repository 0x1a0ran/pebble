      <p>
      Comment listeners are a type of Pebble plugin that allow you to write code that is called
      whenever a comment is added, removed, approved or rejected. To write your own listener, you need to write a Java class that implements the <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/CommentListener.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.event.comment.CommentListener</a> interface
      as shown below. To gain access to the associated
      <a href="../javadoc/pebble/blog/Comment.html">comment</a>, use the <code>getComment()</code> method on the <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/CommentEvent.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.event.comment.CommentEvent</a> object
      that is passed to the callback methods.
      </p>

      <p>
        An empty implementation is provided by the <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/comment/CommentListenerSupport.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.event.comment.CommentListenerSupport</a> class, which
        you can use as a starting point. If you are writing an implementation that is useful for both comments and TrackBacks, you can
        use the <a href="../javadoc/pebble/event/response/BlogEntryResponseListenerSupport.html">net.sourceforge.pebble.event.response.BlogEntryResponseListenerSupport</a>
        as a starting point instead, where there are similar blogEntryResponseX() methods.
      </p>
