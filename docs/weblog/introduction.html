      <p>
        Pebble weblog is the popular server-side blogging tool written in Java. It's small, fast and feature-rich with an
        unrivalled ease of use. Blog content is stored as XML files on disk and served up dynamically, so there's no need to install a database. All maintenance and administration can be performed through your web browser,
        making Pebble ideal for anybody who is constantly on the move or doesn't have direct access to their host.
        A summary of the key features is as follows.
